🗂 Workflow & Architecture

1. Core Concepts

Users → Registered users with their own space/quota.
Folders → Hierarchical structure (like Google Drive).
Files → Belong inside folders (or root).
Metadata DB → Tracks ownership, folder structure, file size, storage usage.
Supabase Storage → Raw storage for actual files.

2. Database Schema (Simplified)

users
id (PK)	name	email	storage_limit	used_storage
folders
id (PK)	user_id (FK)	name	parent_id (nullable FK to folders.id)	created_at
1	123	root	NULL	…
2	123	photos	1	…
files
id (PK)	user_id (FK)	folder_id (FK)	name	path (Supabase key)	size	created_at
1	123	2	beach.png	uploads/uuid.png	500KB	…
3. Storage Flow
Upload File

User selects folder (client sends folderId).

Backend uploads file → Supabase storage (uploads/{uuid}).

Backend inserts into DB (files table with folder_id, size, etc.).

Increment used_storage in users table.

Create Folder

Client sends folder name + parent folder.

Backend inserts into folders table.

No storage change (only metadata).

Delete File

Client sends fileId.

Backend checks DB: does it belong to this user?

If yes → delete from Supabase + remove DB row.

Subtract size from used_storage.

Delete Folder

Client sends folderId.

Backend finds all subfolders + files.

Delete all files from Supabase + DB.

Remove folder entries from DB.

Update used_storage.

Get Storage Usage

SELECT used_storage FROM users WHERE id = ?
(or recalc SUM(size) if needed).

4. API Endpoints (Rough)
POST   /folders          -> create folder
GET    /folders/:id      -> list contents (subfolders + files)
POST   /files            -> upload file
DELETE /files/:id        -> delete file
DELETE /folders/:id      -> delete folder (recursive)
GET    /usage            -> get user’s storage usage

5. Simple Architecture Diagram
[Client App]
     |
     v
[Express/Node.js Backend] ----> [Supabase Storage] (files)
     |
     v
[Postgres DB / Supabase DB] (metadata: users, folders, files)


DB = truth for structure & ownership

Supabase = raw file storage

6. Benefits

Secure (ownership checked via DB, not by guessing paths).

Easy to manage hierarchy (folders via parent-child).

Simple quota management (track size per user).

Scalable for future features (sharing, trash, versioning).

👉 Do you want me to draw a folder+file tree example with DB rows (like showing how "User → Photos → Summer → beach.png" looks in tables)?

You said:

lder structure, file size, stor

and filetype also

Got it 👍 — let’s extend the workflow + schema to include file type as well, since that’s important for a Drive-like system (preview, filtering, icons, etc.).

🗂 Extended Workflow & Schema with File Types
1. Database Schema (Updated)
users
id (PK)	name	email	storage_limit	used_storage
folders
id (PK)	user_id (FK)	name	parent_id (nullable FK to folders.id)	created_at
1	123	root	NULL	…
2	123	photos	1	…
files
id (PK)	user_id (FK)	folder_id (FK)	name	path (Supabase key)	size	type (MIME)	extension	created_at
1	123	2	beach.png	uploads/uuid1.png	500KB	image/png	png	…
2	123	2	resume.pdf	uploads/uuid2.pdf	200KB	application/pdf	pdf	…
3	123	1	song.mp3	uploads/uuid3.mp3	4MB	audio/mpeg	mp3	…
2. File Type Handling

On Upload:

Extract MIME type (req.file.mimetype if using Multer).

Extract extension from original filename.

Store both in DB (type, extension).

Usage:

Show icons (PDF, image, video, etc.).

Enable filters (e.g., "Show only Images").

Control preview (e.g., inline preview for images/PDFs, download for others).

3. Folder + File Example Tree

User: 123

Root (folder_id=1)
 ├── Photos (folder_id=2)
 │    ├── beach.png (file_id=1, type=image/png, size=500KB)
 │    └── resume.pdf (file_id=2, type=application/pdf, size=200KB)
 └── song.mp3 (file_id=3, type=audio/mpeg, size=4MB)

4. APIs (with File Type Awareness)

POST /files → upload, detect file type/extension, save metadata.

GET /files/:id → fetch file details (name, size, type, etc.).

GET /folders/:id → return list of subfolders + files (with types).

GET /files/filter?type=image → list only images.

5. Storage Usage Calculation

Simple → maintain used_storage in users table, update on upload/delete.

Advanced → SELECT type, SUM(size) FROM files WHERE user_id=? GROUP BY type;
(gives per-filetype usage breakdown like “Images: 2GB, Docs: 500MB”).

✨ This way, your system behaves more like Google Drive:

Folder structure

File metadata (size, type, extension, path)

Easy filtering & storage usage breakdown



Structure:

bucket-name/
   user1/
       file1.pdf
       images/photo1.jpg
   user2/
       docs/resume.docx
       images/photo2.jpg


API will look something like this->/userId/filename
